Vimdecrypt

A tool for decrypting vim-encrypted files, either by brute-force, PKZip
plaintext attacks, or whatever.

Uses Python for ease of development. May eventually switch to C for speed.

PKZip decryption algorithm mostly translated from vim source code and from referencing PKware's APPNOTE.TXT.
